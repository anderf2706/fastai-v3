                    <h2 class="undertitle"> About the project </h2>
                    <p>In this subject we were supposed to address a problem that we would solve using Machine Learning methods.</p>
                    <h2 class="undertitle"> Why did we choose this project</h2>
                    <h2 class="undertitle"> What data are we using?</h2>
                    We have trained our algorithms by using open datasets from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia">Kaggle.com</a> and inserted them in this website.
                    <h2 class="undertitle"> Which methods are we using?</h2>
                    We chose to use look further into Supervised Learning by using the k-nearest neighbor and the residual neural network algorithms.-->

                    <p>This page is made as a part of a group project in the course TDT4173 Machine Learning at the Norwegian University of Science 
                        and Technology. In this project we have chosen to use two different machine learning methods to classify real medical 
                        chest x-ray images into two groups: normal and abnormal. The images we used is of children with and without pneumonia. 
                        The data for this was collected from Kaggle.com. For our machine learning methods, we chose to use look further into Supervised 
                        Learning by using the residual neural network with 50 layers (ResNet50) and the k-nearest neighbours (kNN) algorithms. 
                        After training both algorithms the ResNet50 yielded an impressively 97,18% accuracy, while the kNN only accomplished 79.00%. 
                        Because of this, we decided that we would only use the ResNet50 algorithm on this website.
